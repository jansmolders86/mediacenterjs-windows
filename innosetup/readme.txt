Thank you for trying MediacenterJS Beta

This is a Beta build of MediacenterJS. 
MediacenterJS is a media center based 100% on frontend techniques and languages. 

Starting MediacenterJS:

After running this installer and restarting you computer, run "mediacenterjs.exe" located in the root of the directory you've installed MediacenterJS to start the project.
If you close this window, MCJS will stop working. You can also see useful information about what the server is doing, including error messages and other useful information.

Open a browser, preferably Chrome, and type in the address bar: http://localhost:3000
The program will boot in setup mode.
