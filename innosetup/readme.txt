Thank you for trying MediacenterJS Beta

This is the Beta build of MediacenterJS. 
MediacenterJS is a media center running 100% from the comfort of your favourite browser. 

Starting MediacenterJS:

After running this installer and restarting you computer, run "mediacenterjs.exe" located in the root of the directory you've installed MediacenterJS to start the project.
If you close this window, MCJS will stop working. You can also see useful information about what the server is doing, including error messages and other useful information.
